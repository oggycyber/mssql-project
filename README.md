# Cafeteria Database Project in MSSQL

Developed a database project in MSSQL themed “Cafeteria Reservation System”. Through the project, I applied E-R diagrams, tabulation, normalization processes and create/execute SQL/T-SQL queries on database mechanisms such as stored procedures, triggers. 

The report file includes all the steps from the creation of the database to the preparation and execution of SQL/T-SQL queries.

**[!] While developing the database, all the data used does not contain any real or sensitive information. However, potentially sensitive data has been blackboxed.**
